# 10th March 2017

## All knowledge accumlulated here are provided by the workshop participants.

## Please get ready the following BEFORE the workshop:
- downloaded iris data
- know how to load data into a `dataframe`
- make sure you have `sklearn` package

## Load data into dataframe

## Split data into training set and test set

## Apply k-nearest-neighbour for classification
- predict gender based some characteristic
- predict type of food
- predict user preference
- predict a user profile based their behaviour
- predict sentiment

### What is k-nearest-neighbour?

### What happens when parameters change?

| n_neighbors | weights | distance_metrics | accuracy |
|-------------|---------|------------------|----------|
|5|uniform|euclidean|0.95|
|5|uniform|manhattan|0.93|
|5|uniform|euclidean|0.95|
|21|uniform|euclidean|0.91|
|17|uniform|euclidean|0.95|
|31|uniform|manhattan|0.91|
|5|distance|euclidean|1|


### Other algorithms?

## Interesting Stuff:
- put the link here if you have found interesting stuff to share
 - http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html
 - http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/index.html (pretty data visualisations)
 - Used this service for the first time last week http://www.slidebristol.com/  - interested in the algorithms they are using to manage routes (they are based in this building!)
